## 🧪 Environment Setup (Step-by-Step)

Follow the steps below to set up the development environment for this project.


### ✅ Step 1 — Create Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment with the required Python version:

```
conda create -n environment name (example: DL_Project) python=3.10.9
```

### ✅ Step 2 — Install Dependencies (IMPORTANT ORDER)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
📌 **Notes:**

- The `requirements.txt` file already includes **all dependencies** needed for:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training (**TF-IDF + CNN**, **IndoBERT + CNN**)
  - Evaluation
  - Streamlit application
- **Do not install libraries manually** to avoid version conflicts.
- Follow the installation order strictly as described in this guide.

### ✅ Step 3 — Register Kernel to VS Code

Open terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ``):
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name DL_Project --display-name "DL_Project"
```

### ✅ Step 4 — Restart VS Code

After registering the kernel, restart Visual Studio Code:

1. **Close VS Code**
2. **Reopen VS Code**
3. Select the kernel: **DL_Project**

### ✅ Step 5 — Environment Test (MANDATORY)
```
import tensorflow as tf
import typing_extensions

print(tf.__version__)
print("typing OK")
```

Expected output:
```
2.13.0
typing OK
```

✅ **If successful → Environment setup COMPLETE**

## 🏋️ Model Training

Run the training process from the `src` directory:

```
python train.py
```
⚠️ **Important:**

Before running the application, make sure the training process has been completed.  
The Streamlit app depends on the trained models generated by `train.py`.

This process will:

- Train **TF-IDF + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Train **IndoBERT + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Save trained models will go to:

```
outputs/models/
```

---
## 🖥️ Run the Streamlit Application
After the training process is completed, run the Streamlit application from the `app` directory:

```
# streamlit run app.py
```
Open the application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8501 (example)

```
### 📌 Note

- Streamlit does **NOT always open automatically**
- The VS Code terminal will display a local URL
- Use **Ctrl + Click** on the link, or copy it into your browser
